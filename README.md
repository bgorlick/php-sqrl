php-sqrl
========

PHP implementation written to test the android app. It's done fast and is **far from production code**. But it works, with some shortcuts. If any one want to fix them please send me a pull request. This code also works with php 5.2. I think thats important since a lot of hosting providers still use that. 

## Shortcuts
1. The signature is sent to http://ed25519.herokuapp.com/api/Verify for verification. Not done in PHP
2. QR code is done by Google API. This should be easy to fix with a lib.
